## Unveiling Trends, Optimising Sales, and Empowering Growth
 # Introduction
The problem statement revolves around a fictional bike company that has a huge dataset of
their sales and production. It includes information about customers, employees, orders,
products, and suppliers at the bike company. Each table contains relevant columns
representing different attributes and relationships between entities. Through this analysis,
we explore the database's structure, delve into the data, and apply SQL queries to perform
tasks such as retrieving sales information, analysing product trends, and understanding
customer behaviour. We further analyse the specifics of data using Pivot Tables and create a
final dashboard to present our analysis.
